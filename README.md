# Power Mode - Key Button 
In this example shows how to implement a key in sleep mode without change the algorithm
and shows how much current it takes and save for us

* This project tested on STM32F4-DISCO


## Current (mA)
| Mode | Led State | Current |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Normal | On | 85.7 mA |
| Normal | Off | 85.1 mA |
| Sleep | On | 61.5 mA |
| Sleep | Off | 60.3 mA |
